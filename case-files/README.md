# Atom47 case

This is the 3d printed case. The STL file is obviously for use in slicers, but if you wish to make any changes to it you can use the STEP or Fusion archive files. Please read the license before use. I ADVISE YOU TO PRINT AT 102% SIZE TO COMPENSATE FOR SHRINKAGE

This case should be compatible with the stock Vortex Core assembly as well.
